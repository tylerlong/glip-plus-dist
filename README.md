##### How does it work?

It automates QuickTime Player to record your screen.

##### Why not use QuickTime Player instead?

With Glip Plus, you can make a screen recording by simply 3 mouse clicks,
which is much more convenient than using QuickTime Player directly.


## Activate hotkey

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd>

This hotkey brings the app to the front of all other apps and position it to the central of your screen, even if the app is miniaturized.



## Auto upgrade

Whenever there are new versions available, the app will alert you to upgrade.

You can also let it automatically download and install updates.
